      <div className="text-white/60 mb-2 text-xs md:text-sm">
        JUNLALA is a leading AI tech company based in Silicon Valley, pioneering
        the integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) with Decentralized
        Physical Infrastructure Network (DePIN) technology, creating an AI+DePIN
        project on the ETH ecosystem. JUNLALA provides personalized intelligent
        services in a decentralized way, ensuring top-tier privacy protection
        and aiming to build a secure and efficient smart future. Its innovation
        lies in utilizing a decentralized computing power network to break the
        centralized model of traditional AI services, effectively addressing
        privacy and cost issues in AI service and computing power supply.

        In the JUNLALA ecosystem, users are not just consumers of AI services
        but contributors to the network. By operating nodes and participating in
        computing power mining, users can earn $LALA token rewards, forming a
        self-driven decentralized economic model. This approach reduces the cost
        of AI services, enhances the availability and distribution of computing
        power, and promotes the adoption and development of decentralized AI
        services by combining Web3 and AI technologies.
